# Hangman-Game
A Python game of Hangman

Game randomly picks one of the words in the list for the player to guess. Duplicate letters in a word need to be typed twice.
If the player guesses incorrectly, the program draws a part of the hangman until the drawing is complete.

You've played hangman before. This is pretty self explanatory.
